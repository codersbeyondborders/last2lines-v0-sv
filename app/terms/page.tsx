                To maintain the quality and safety of our platform, Last2Lines
                utilizes a hybrid moderation process:

                  We employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automated software
                  tools to assist in screening submissions. These AI systems
                  analyze text for technical attributes (such as rhyme and
                  structure) and automatically flag potential policy violations,
                  including plagiarism, spam, obscenity, and hate speech.

                  move, or delete any submission at its sole discretion,

              <p>
                While our moderation systems primarily review submissions for
                poetic structure and rhyme rather than thematic intent, we
                enforce a strict zero-tolerance policy against hate speech.
                Users must not submit content that attacks, dehumanizes, or
                incites hatred against individuals or groups based on:
